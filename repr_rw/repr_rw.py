	"""
	If a text file contains the representation of Python objects, this
	generator can read it to recreate those objects. Each line in the file
	must be a string returned by function repr. Empty lines are ignored. Each
	iteration of this generator yields one object.

	Recreating objects requires to import their class unless they all are of a
	built-in type. For this purpose, you need to provide the necessary import
	statements and the paths to the parent directory of the imported classes'
	module or package. All import statements must match regular expression
	"from .+ import .+".
	
	However, you do not need to provide a path for standard and installed
	packages.

	Args:
		file_path (str or pathlib.Path): the path to a text file that contains
			object representations.
		importations (generator, list, set or tuple):
			class import statements (str). Defaults to None.
		paths (generator, list, set or tuple): the paths (str or pathlib.Path)
			to the imported classes. Defaults to None.

	Yields:
		an object recreated from its representation.

	Raises:
		FileNotFoundError: if the file indicated by argument file_path does
			not exist.
		ImportError: if an import statement is incorrect.
		ModuleNotFoundError: if an imported class' module or package cannot
			be found. An item in argument paths may be incorrect.
		NameError: if a required class was not imported.
		TypeError: if argument file_path or an item in argument paths is not
			of type str or pathlib.Path.
		ValueError: if an import statement does not match regular expression
			"from .+ import .+".
		Exception: any exception raised upon the parsing of an object
			representation.
